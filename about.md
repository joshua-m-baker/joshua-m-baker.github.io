Hello, my name is Josh. I am a student at IU, working on a Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science, with a planned graduation date of December, 2020.  

Here's a link to my [github](https://github.com/joshua-m-baker).

I am building this website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), and it is still a work in progress.
